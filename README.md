# Next/React/Express JWT Auth Example
Here's an example of using JWT to authenticate between two servers. The frontend is using React and Next.js. Routing is handled by Next Routes. State is handled by Redux and the Next Redux Wrapper. The backend is using Express - and is providing a mock user DB via a JSON file.

To Install (with yarn, or use NPM):
```yarn install```

To run both servers:
```yarn run dev```

Note that on Windows, you may need to run the API seperately as its a combined bash command.

Then navigate to http://localhost:4400 in your browser!
